# ðŸ§© Sudoku Solver in Java

This project is a simple and efficient **Sudoku Solver** built using the **backtracking algorithm** in Java. It can solve any valid 9x9 Sudoku puzzle where empty cells are represented by `0`.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Solves any valid 9x9 Sudoku puzzle
- âœ… Uses recursion and backtracking
- âœ… Checks constraints for rows, columns, and 3x3 subgrids
- âœ… Clean, modular code with comments
- âœ… Console-based output

## ðŸ“‹ How the Algorithm Works

1. Traverse the Sudoku board cell by cell.
2. When an empty cell (value `0`) is found:
   - Try placing digits from 1 to 9.
   - For each digit, check if it's **safe** using:
     - Row validation
     - Column validation
     - 3x3 grid validation
3. If safe, place the digit and recursively solve the rest.
4. If it leads to a dead-end, **backtrack** by removing the digit.
5. Repeat until the board is completely filled or no solution exists.

## ðŸ”¢ Sample Input

```java
int sudoku[][] = {
    {0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0},
    {4, 9, 0, 1, 5, 7, 0, 0, 2},
    {0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 4, 1, 9, 0},
    {1, 8, 5, 0, 6, 0, 0, 2, 0},
    {0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 6, 0},
    {9, 6, 0, 4, 0, 5, 3, 0, 0},
    {0, 3, 0, 0, 7, 2, 0, 0, 4},
    {0, 4, 9, 0, 3, 0, 0, 5, 7},
    {8, 2, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 1, 3}
};
Solution exists
6 1 8 9 4 2 7 3 5 
4 9 7 1 5 7 8 6 2 
... (completed grid)
```
